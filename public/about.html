<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is James Lemmen. 
  I am a 34 year old male. 
  Born and raised in Michigan. 
  Currently I live in California, 
  after having spent 4 years in Florida. 
  I recently obtained a certificate for Web Development with Bootstrap
through Udemy.</p>

<p>As you can see by my portfolio I have ample skills nessecary
  to complete any tasks given to me. These skills include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
  Bootstrap, React.JavaScript, and more.
</p>

<p>As a web developer it is my dream to create websites that help people, such
  as those with mental disabilities, small business owners, and more. I grew up struggling to find myself
  and eventually through all the anger, depression, self hatred, I found myself
  through coding/progrramming.
</p>

<p>I have spent many years learning all I can on my own, starting with my
  GED. After having entered a program with an estimated 2 year completion time.
  I finished with a total 56 hour completion time. For someone who couldn't focus
  on anything once I found my will to go on, I knew there was more left for me to do.
</p>

<p>My greatest acomplishment in life was when I became a real life hero
  back in highschool. I witnessed a teacher wrongfully accused of misconduct
  all because he wouldn't fall for a students advances. After proving his innocence
  and doing the right thing, I was treated with all kinds of disrespect by both students
  and staff, however, I would do it again.
</p>

<p>In the great words of Collosus and Deadpool "There are only 4 or 5 
  moments where you can be a hero.", I found one of them. Now I am on a quest to
  find the others. I believe that using the skills I got that saved my life
  I will be able to be a hero again and save others or improve their lives too.
